        <h1>A FULL EXPERIENCE WEEK</h1>
        <h5>Zion Rafting Club has the possibility of practicing rafting with different degrees of difficulty, experiencing emotion and vertigo in an always surprising natural setting.
            The river rafting of Heber J. Grant National Park invites you to go through immense forests through its exciting rapids full of action. During the summer, the flow grows forming holes and waves that produce rapids of high intensity.
            Excursions take place on inflatable rafts that usually hold up to 10 people. They are accompanied by a professional guide, who will provide the necessary instructions to enjoy safe navigation to the fullest.</h5>
        <h2>Where can you go rafting?</h2>
        <h4>We offer you 4 scenarios so that you can practice this great sport with different degrees of intensity:</h4>
        
        <h5>Floated on the Bright Light river (Intensity 1 and 2): An ideal proposal to share with family or friends, navigating a calm river with crystal clear waters, with backwaters and gentle currents, a few kilometers from the Bright Light city.</h5>
            <div class="difficulty_img">
                <img class="difficulty" src="images/difficulty_Easy.png" alt="difficulty">
            </div>
        <h5>Lower part of the Bright Light river(Intensity 2 and 3): Ideal for the whole family. After a brief talk about safety regulations, the descent down the River begins, surrounded by high peaks and with the lush vegetation typical of the Heber J. Grant National Park and an also surprising variety of birds. </h5>
            <div class="difficulty_img">
                <img class="difficulty" src="images/difficulty_medium.png" alt="difficulty">
            </div>
        <h5>Upper part of the Bright Light river (Intensity 3 and 4): To carry out this excursion it is necessary to have a good physical condition and to know how to swim.
            After accessing by land through the river valley, which forms the northern limit of the Heber J. Grant National Park, the last section is navigated, with vertiginous jumps through narrow canyons. The navigation concludes upon reaching the limit with the Gran Cañon Dorado park.</h5>
